### HTML5/CSS

| [Say Hello to HTML Elements](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/say-hello-to-html-elements) | <ul><li>You can edit code in a **text editor**.*Some popular text editors are [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com), [Atom](https://atom.io), and [Brackets](http://brackets.io).*<li>Most HTML **elements** have an opening **tag** `<>` and a closing **tag** `</>`. <li>The only difference between opening tags `<>` and closing tags  `</>` is that closing tags have a slash `/` after their opening angle bracket. *The word immediately after the opening `<` or `</` is the element name.*</ul> | `<h1> SOME TEXT HERE </h1> ` |
|[Headline with the h2 Element](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/headline-with-the-h2-element) | <ul><li>Elements tell the browser about the **structure** of your website.<li>`h1` elements are often used for main **headings**, and `h2, h3, h4, h5` and `h6` elements can be used for sub-headings. </ul> | `<h1> Main Heading </h1>`<br><br>`<h2>Second Heading</h2>`<br><br>`<h3>Third Heading</h3>`|

| [Delete HTML Elements](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/delete-html-elements) | <ul><li>*Really? You want to know how to delete an element? Try the backspace key...*</ul> | There aren't any elements here. I guess I deleted them. Oops! |

| [Use CSS Selectors to Style Elements](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/use-css-selectors-to-style-elements) |<ul><li>You can also change the way an element looks by using **CSS** style rules. Your CSS will go inside a `style` element.<li>**CSS style rules have the format:<br> `selector { property: value; }`**<li>You can use any element name (like `h2` or `p`) in front of the brackets to **select** _all_ elements of that type. </ul> | `<style>`<br><br>`h2 { color: purple; }`<br><br>`</style>`<br></br>`<h2> This  will be purple. </h2>`<br>`<p> This will not be purple.</p>`|
| [Use a CSS Class to Style an Element](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/use-a-css-class-to-style-an-element) | <ul><li>The HTML `class` attribute is used for elements that have something in common. It looks like this:<br> `class="class-name"`<li>To select elements with a certain class in CSS, use a period `.` followed by the class name: <br>`.class-name { ... }`</ul> | `<style>`<br>`.yellow { color: yellow; }`<br>`</style>`<br><br>`<h2 class="yellow"> This will be yellow. </h2>` |
| [Style Multiple Elements with a CSS Class](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/style-multiple-elements-with-a-css-class) | <ul><li>Because classes are used for grouping elements, you can add the `class` attribute to as many elements as you want.</ul> | `<style>`<br>`.yellow { color: yellow; }`<br>`</style>`<br><br>`<h2 class="yellow"> This is yellow. </h2>` <br> `<p class="yellow"> This is also yellow. </p>`|
|[Change the Font Size of an Element](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/change-the-font-size-of-an-element)| <ul><li>You can change the **font size** (the size of text) by using the CSS `font-size` property. <li>One of the most common ways to measure font size is in **pixels** (`px`). The default font size on Chrome is `16px`.<li>It is also common to measure font size in **ems** (`em`). A font size of `2em` will be twice as big as normal text.</ul> | `<style>`<br>`h2 { font-size: 2em; }`<br>`p { font-size: 20px; }`<br>`</style>`<br><br>`<h2> This is bigger. </h2>` <br> `<p> This is big. </p>` |
| [Set the Font Family of an Element](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/set-the-font-family-of-an-element) | <ul><li>You can change the **font family** (the style of text) by using the CSS `font-family` property. <li>You can use the **keywords** `serif`, `sans-serif` and `monospace` to use the browser's default font for those font styles.<li>*You can add more than one `property: value;` pair to your style rules, just keep the opening bracket `{` on the same line as the `selector`.* </ul> | `<style>`<br>`p {`<br>`font-size: 20px;`<br>`font-family: sans-serif;`<br>`}`<br>`</style>`<br><br>`<p> This is big sans-serif text. </p>` |
|[Import a Google Font](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/import-a-google-font) |<ul><li>You can also use the name of a specific font to set the font family. <li>You can use a basic set of fonts available on your computer (such as `Arial`, `Helvetica`, or `Times New Roman`) or you can **import** another font  from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) or somewhere else. <li>*You can link to another file, such as a CSS file, with a `<link>` element.*</ul>| `<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Quicksand" rel="stylesheet">`<br><br>`<style>`<br>`h2 { font-family: Quicksand; }`<br>`</style>`<br><br>`<h2> Heading in the Quicksand font </h2>`|
|[Specify How Fonts Should Degrade](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/specify-how-fonts-should-degrade) | <ul><li>*Not all fonts and features work in all browsers.* Sometimes we have to **fall back**, or degrade, to a different option.<li>You can include a list of font names for the CSS `font-family` property, and the browser will use the first one that it can.<li> The font names should be separated by a comma `,`. Usually keywords such as `sans-serif` come last.</ul> | `<style>`<br>`p { font-family: Arial, sans-serif; }`<br>`</style>`<br><br>`<p> If the computer doesn't have Arial, it will use whatever sans-serif font it has. </p>`
