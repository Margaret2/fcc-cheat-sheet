|--- | ---| ----|
| [Say Hello to HTML Elements](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/say-hello-to-html-elements) | <ul><li>You can edit code in a **text editor**.*Some popular text editors are [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com), [Atom](https://atom.io), and [Brackets](http://brackets.io).*<li>Most HTML **elements** have an opening **tag** `<>` and a closing **tag** `</>`. <li>The only difference between opening tags `<>` and closing tags  `</>` is that closing tags have a slash `/` after their opening angle bracket. *The word immediately after the opening `<` or `</` is the element name.*</ul> | `<h1> SOME TEXT HERE </h1> ` |
|[Headline with the h2 Element](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/headline-with-the-h2-element) | <ul><li>Elements tell the browser about the **structure** of your website.<li>`h1` elements are often used for main **headings**, and `h2, h3, h4, h5` and `h6` elements can be used for sub-headings. </ul> | `<h1> Main Heading </h1>`<br><br>`<h2>Second Heading</h2>`<br><br>`<h3>Third Heading</h3>`|

| [Use CSS Selectors to Style Elements](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/use-css-selectors-to-style-elements) |<ul><li>You can also change the way an element looks by using **CSS** style rules.

The default font size on Chrome is `16px`.<li>It is also common to measure font size in **ems** (`em`). A font size of `2em` will be twice as big as normal text.</ul> | `<style>`<br>`h2 { font-size: 2em; }`<br>`p { font-size: 20px; }`<br>`</style>`<br><br>`<h2> This is bigger. </h2>` <br> `<p> This is big. </p>` |

|[Specify How Fonts Should Degrade](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/specify-how-fonts-should-degrade) | <ul><li>Not all fonts and features work in all browsers. Sometimes we have to **fall back**, or **degrade**, to a different option.<li>You can include a list of font names for the CSS `font-family` property, and the browser will use the first one that it can.<li> The font names should be separated by a comma `,`.
